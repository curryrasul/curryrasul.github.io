Job - Software/system - engineer

About me:

My name is Magamedrasul Ibragimov. I'm 21. Right now I'm last year student of BMSTU and living in Moscow. I like to build Web3 (smart-contracts development, Defi/NFT protocols) and I also like modern cryptography a lot. 

I like to solve complex problems and like to learn new things.

* Compiler Frontend Development
* Little experience in functional programming languages (Scheme, Scala)

Experience (several projects on each skill):

Smart-contract development:

* [Loto](https://github.com/curryrasul/loto) - NFT Raffle project on NEAR Protocol
* [Wing](https://github.com/curryrasul/wing) - NFT-collateralized loans platform on NEAR Protocol (Just started)
* [Heads or Tails](https://github.com/curryrasul/heads-or-tails) - Commit-reveal scheme demo on NEAR Protocol

Applied cryptography:

* [Proof of set membership](https://github.com/curryrasul/knapsack-snark) - zkSNARK proof/verifier on Free TON (Everscale)
* [Shamir's secret](https://github.com/curryrasul/shamir-secret) - Shamir's secret sharing in Rust (demo)
* [PRNG](https://github.com/curryrasul/prng) - Pseudo random numbers distribution (demo)

Compiilers/Interpreters:

* [Scheme interpreter](https://github.com/curryrasul/scheme-interpreter) - Interpreter for the subset of Scheme language in Rust (university course project)

Achievements:

* 2-nd place of [Definition Hackathon](https://definitionhack.io/1inch) (1inch - track). We built xOrder protocol (based on 1inch limit-order protocol) (to earn interest on order while it's not filled). Role - one of the developers.
* 3-d place Free TON (Everscale) (Groth16 zkSNARK Use Cases 2) [contest](https://forum.freeton.org/t/contest-proposal-groth16-zksnark-proof-verification-use-cases-part-ii/11291). Role - solo hacker. Built proof of set membership system.
