Desired job position - Software/System-engineer

About me:

My name is Magamedrasul Ibragimov. I'm 21. Right now I'm last year student of Bauman Moscow State Technical University (applied math and informatics). 
I like to build Web3 (smart-contracts development, DeFi/NFT protocols) and I also like modern cryptography a lot. 

I like to solve difficult problems and I like to learn new things.

* Compiler Frontend Development
* Little experience in functional programming languages (Scheme, Scala)

Achievements:

* 2-nd place of [Definition Hackathon](https://definitionhack.io/1inch) (1inch - track). We built xOrder protocol (based on 1inch limit-order protocol) (to earn interest on order while it's not filled). Role - one of the developers.
* 3-d place Free TON (Everscale) (Groth16 zkSNARK Use Cases 2) [contest](https://forum.freeton.org/t/contest-proposal-groth16-zksnark-proof-verification-use-cases-part-ii/11291). Role - solo hacker. Built proof of set membership system.
