I'm Magamedrasul Ibragimov, I'm interested in cryptography, 
programming languages and engineering in general. 

I work at Privacy & Scaling Explorations of Ethereum Foundation as zk-engineer (but I also do a lot of Rust, Solidity and other stuff).

This is the web-site, where I want to share my knowledge with you, but mostly to learn myself
while writing.
